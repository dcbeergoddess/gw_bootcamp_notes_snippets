    <p>My full name is Rachel Michel Murray and I was born in Missoula, Montana. I spent my elementary school years living in Scottsdale, Arizona and my High School time in Kansas City, Missouri before ending up in Washington, DC for my undergrad at Georgetown University and have been here ever since.</p>
    <p>During my time at Georgetown I ended up getting a job one summer waiting tables at the Brickskeller right as the American Craft Beer Scene was exploding in the area</p>
    <p>After 15 years working in the resturant industry I took a sabatical and started looking for what is next or my career. Over the past 10 years I have spent some time dabbling in the tech world and am looking forward to finally putting all the pieces together.</p>
