      // Variables can be strings, numbers, or booleans (true / false)
      // using var is outdated. we will work with it at first but should shift over to newer way. more modern code uses the other way. different way to declare variables.
                  // const (var is closer to this than it is to let)
                 // let
      var name = "Snow White";

      // ALWAYS HAVE DEV CONSOLE OPEN

      alert("Welcome: " + name);
          // use alert with open parentheses. Once/Anytime you have a string value JavaScript knows thats the + will join the strings together instead of adding  
          // concatenation
      

      // CONDITIONALS

      // Here we create our prompt and confirm variables which will store user input.
