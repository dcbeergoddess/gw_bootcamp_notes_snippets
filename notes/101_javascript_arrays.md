### ARRAYS

Another data type 
- A collection of data
- They can have one element, they can have 1,000 of elements
- use [] : Square Brackets, with each distinct item seperated by quotes and commas
- don't put comma after last element in array
- can have mixed arrays (different data types) but not recommended

.length (how many elements are in the array)
index starts at 0 by default
>>> see example in html file

if console out .length will console the number of items in array

index value is the position in the array put number in brackets after array variable [0]

*** .indexOf() ***

logs index position

you will get -1 if it does not find what you are looking for
  - return one that can't possibly be in the array since it starts at 0
  - won't throw up error becuase otherwise your code would break

*** .toLowerCase() ***

- not used for arrays 
- used for strings

in JavaScript strings are case sensitive
type strings all lowercase
take what user types and make it lowercase

var userTypeLower = userType.toLowerCase();
